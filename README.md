<h1>Preparing Test Cases on Soccer Players Filtering Program</h1>

<h2>Assignment Description</h2>
<p>The input dataset will contain a list of soccer players and their information, including name, age, country, overall rating, and position. The
source code retrieves relevant information from this dataset by making use of initially defined functions. The defined functions are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>get_best_player_and _number_of_world_classes:-</strong>A world class player is defined as players with an overall rating >= 80, and the the best player is the player with the highest overall rating</li>
  
</ul>
<p> The comprehensive tests I built will ensure that accurate information retrieval is done when the source code functions are called.</p>
